<H3>The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages</H3>
Simon Peyton Jones, published by Prentice Hall, 1987.
<p>
My 1987 book is now out of print, but it is now available online in its entirety.
I owe a big debt of thanks to Marnie Montgomery, who made this possible.
<p>
<ul>
<li> <A href="start.htm">Read it online.</A>
<li> <a href="slpj-1987-book.tar.gz">Download it to read locally.</a>
</ul>
<p>
The book is available as scanned JPG images, so the full download is large.
Whether you download it or read it online, note the following:
<ul>
<li>The big arrows, at the top left and right of each page, move backward
and forward one page.
<li>The table of contents is clickable.  You can get to the table of contents by
clicking the link displayed at the top of each page.
<li>The index is not (yet) clickable.   You can get to the index by
clicking the link displayed at the top of each page.
<li>There is no way (yet) to go to a particular page number; use the TOC as your
entry point.
</ul>
I'd be interested to know who uses this resource, if only to tell Marnie how
many people have used her work.  Drop me a line!
